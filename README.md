# CDDA Chunk mover
 Copy overmap tiles from one map to another using python
 Copy player from one world to another
 
 There is a simple menu system with error handling and should be fairly straightforward
 1. Run the script
 2. Input your CDDA save file location
 3. The options will auto populate with what you can do
	a. If you want to copy an overmap chunk, fill in the world to copy from, and the world to copy to.
		Enter coordinates from in-game into the menu.
		The option to copy/paste your chunk will appear
	b. If you want to copy a player save file, just enter the two worlds you want to transfer from and to.
		The option to move your player will appear
4. All done! The interface should make it easy to copy multiple chunks or players to other worlds.
