# CDDA Chunk mover

There is a simple menu system with error handling and should be fairly straightforward

 1. Run the script
 2. Input your CDDA save file location
 3. The options will auto populate with what you can do

## Copy overmap tiles from one map to another using python
If you want to copy an overmap chunk...
1. fill in the world to copy from, and the world to copy to.
2. Enter coordinates from in-game into the menu.
3. The option to copy/paste your chunk will appear

## Copy player from one world to another
If you want to copy a player save file...
1. Enter the two worlds you want to transfer from and to.
2. The option to move your player will appear

All done! The terminal menu should make it easy to copy multiple chunks or players to other worlds.
